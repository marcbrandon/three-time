# three-time
This simple application takes a list of participants and divides them into groups of three then assigns them to weekly sessions ensuring everyone is matched with each other at least once without repeating matchups.

## Known issues and potential improvements
- Need to support cases where the participant list is not evenly divisible by three.
- Allow for adding and removing participants via form controls.
